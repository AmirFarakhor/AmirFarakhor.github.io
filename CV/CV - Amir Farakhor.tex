%\subsection*{RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}
%\hrule
%\vspace{0.2cm}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item {\bf Research Assistant, Stanford University}, Sep 1998 - Present. \\
%{\bf Parallel Packet Switches}, (Sep 1998 - June 2000): We ask the question as to whether it is possible to build a large switch
%from multiple smaller switches stacked in parallel, called the parallel packet switch (PPS), 
%such that it behaves exactly like a large switch. I designed an algorithm and derived the
%first analytical proof of the conditions under which this is possible. I then extended 
%this work so that the PPS can support quality of service and multicast traffic. Later, I derived
%and analyzed a practical distributed algorithm for the PPS. This research demonstrates how switching capacity can be scaled in an efficient
%manner.
%
%\vspace{0.1cm}
%{\bf Distributed Shared Memory Routers}, (Jan 2001 - Mar 2002): From a network designer's
%perspective a shared memory router is ideal in that the packets
%are stored in a central location and the memory bandwidth and space is shared across
%packets from all ports. This sharing helps in conserving memory space and results in low cost
%and low power routers. However, it is a widely held myth that such shared memory routers are not
%scalable to higher speeds due to limitations imposed on the speed of a single memory. I worked 
%on the first demonstration and proof to show how to build and scale the capacity of 
%shared memory routers using distributed memories.  
%
%\vspace{0.1cm}
%{\bf The Pigeon Hole Principle for Routers}, (Sep 1998 - Mar 2002): In the course of our
%work on routers we derived a technique called ``Constraint Sets". This was used to
%analyze a number of router architectures especially those with a single stage of
%buffering. The ``Constraint Set" technique is a generalization of the
%Pigeon Hole principle. Later, I extended this work to Combined Input Output Queued
%routers, which are routers with two stages of buffering.
%
%\vspace{0.1cm}
%{\bf Scalable, High Performance Packet Buffers}, (Sep 2000 - Mar 2002): Packet buffers on
%Internet Routers have two requirements. They need to be large and have to be accessed at a very high rate. Unfortunately commodity memories such as
%DRAMs have slow access speeds though they allow large storage, while commodity SRAMs allow fast
%access but are inefficient in storage. I analyzed a well-known hierarchical buffer architecture
%that has a small amount of SRAM cache combined with DRAM. However, unlike computer architecture
%where caching only allows statistical guarantees, the algorithms proposed exploit the
%characteristics of memory requirements for networking
%to enable the design of a memory architecture which gives deterministic latency
%guarantees. I showed how the optimal algorithm can be modeled using difference equations and used adversarial 
%traffic patterns to derive bounds on the minimum size of the SRAM memory.
%This resulting memory architecture supports
%the access speeds of SRAM and has the storage capacity of DRAM. 
%
%
%\vspace{0.1cm}
%{\bf Deterministic Architectures for Statistics and State Maintenance}, (Sep 2000 - Mar 2002): A number
%of packet processing tasks in the Internet put a large demand on the costs and the power budget for designers. We specifically evaluate two such
%tasks; namely maintaining statistics counters and maintaining state of connections. We
%propose architectural solutions and derive optimal algorithms. Our analytical results are based on the 
%use of potential functions to model the system. This research shows how the above packet processing 
%tasks can be scaled to very high line rates.
%
%\vspace{0.1cm}
%{\bf Distributed Algorithms for Buffered Crossbars}, (June 2002 - Present):  Internet core routers have been designed lately using a crossbar switching fabric. 
%While it is possible to build routers using crossbars which give deterministic performance
%guarantees, the algorithms required to realize this are centralized and have high
%computational complexity. Hence in practice most routers do not
%use these algorithms and do not give any guaranteed performance.
%A colleague of mine, Shang-Tse Chuang,  and I analyzed a slight modification to the
%crossbar fabric called the buffered crossbar, which is simply a crossbar with a small number of buffers in it. 
%We derive a bijection between a crossbar and a buffered crossbar to show that any
%algorithm on the buffered crossbar can be implemented on the crossbar and vice versa. We
%derive a suite of distributed algorithms on the buffered crossbar and derive
%analytically the conditions under which they can give both statistical and deterministic
%guarantees for both first come first serve routers and routers which support quality of
%service. Since these distributed algorithms can operate independently on each input and
%output port of the switch without communicating with each other, they are readily implementable.
%Our results show that Internet routers built using crossbars can be re-designed in a
%practical manner using buffered crossbars and give superior performance and
%deterministic guarantees.
%
%\vspace{0.1cm}
%{\bf Stability Properties of the Maximum Size Matching}, (May 2002 - Present):
%Contrary to intuition, it is known in queueing theory that a greedy policy that
%maximizes the instantaneous throughput in a system of queues may not maximize the long term throughput. 
%However, greedy policies are of interest because they are usually easy to implement.
%A maximum size matching is an example of such a greedy scheduling policy on crossbar
%switches. I analyzed this greedy policy and showed that with 
%stochastically constrained traffic and the framework of scheduling packets in batches,
%the greedy policy maximizes the long term throughput. A number of open
%problems remain in this area and at the time of writing, this work is in progress.
%
%\item {\bf Research Intern, ATL SprintLabs}, June - Sep. 2001. \\
%{\bf Internet Measurements \& Deflection Routing:} Our work involved designing a practical solution for tackling link overload on the network
%backbone. First, I analyzed how overload occurs on the Sprint backbone. 
%This involved writing a tool to characterize link overload and create
%statistics from SNMP measurements collected for a period of a year from the
%Sprint backbone. With the intuition gained from these statistics we concluded that there
%was a need to alleviate overload using deflection routing.
%I suggested a method of setting link weights on the Sprint network (taking advantage of
%the topology characteristics) to enable a loop free deflection routing algorithm.
